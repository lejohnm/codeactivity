### Demo 

The DRY principle is demonstrated by showing how a generalized function can be used to log arrays

This demo introduces a more advanced concept to students, showing how any argument (including an array) can be passed to a function for some type of operation

# Live code

Break the code in order to show more explictly what is happening in the function ... ie pass in a text string instead of an array
