### Your assignment

* Starting from a blank HTML file, create an array with 10 question objects. Each object in the array should be structured as follows: 

  `{ q: "QUESTION", a: "ANSWER" }`
* Remember that an array can hold any primitives or objects. So this array of objects could be structured as follows (as an example)

var game = [{q: 'Birds can fly', a: true}, {q: 'Fish can fly', a: false}]

* Then create code that will ask the user questions, one by one. The user must answer by hitting t (for true) or f (for false).

* Check the user's answer against the correct answer, and provide them with an alert telling them if they are right or wrong.

* **BONUS:** Keep track of the user's score.

* **HINT:** 
Don't worry about having DRY code to start with. Just focus on getting working code first.

You can use SWITCH CASE or if-else to control the flow of your logic
