### Your Assignment

* Open the app in unsolved and refactor it! Here is what you should do:

- add a new menu option to the app. When the user selects a key that you designate, it triggers a function which prints the array of objects to the webpage

* Hint 
- your function will need to iterate (loop) through the array
- see the comments in the code for additional direction
