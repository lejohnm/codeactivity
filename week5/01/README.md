### Quick Demo
* THE TODO APP

* We've been building important skills between DOM manipulation, functions, arrays, objects and loops

* In this demo, lets loop through an array and use functions to render the results to the DOM

* Demo highlights
- Using on the onkey event to trigger a workflow
- Use of an array as our in memory database. Note the array holds objects
- Use of DOM manipulation to interact with the user and build a summary of completed and open tasks
- use of SWITCH CASE method instead of if else
- Use of cascading style sheets to demonstrate precedence. Open inspect to see inheritance
