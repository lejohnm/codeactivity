### Activity 4


### Conditionals

With this demo, we go a little deeper on conditionals and workflow

Note the logic of this small application and the boolean conditions which trigger the execution of a block of code.

Note we are also writing to a result to the DOM when we have 2 false booleans

* Challenge
How could we improve the logical workflow of this demo in capturing the name of a basketball team?

How could es6 let variable affect the results for displaying the name of a team in an improved logical workflow
