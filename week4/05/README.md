### Your assignment

* Create a website (from scratch) that asks users if they like to travel.

* If they respond with "yes", write the following to the page: "Here’s a vacation borchure!"

* If they respond with "no", write the following to the page: "Here’s some ideas for a staycation!"

Note that the alerts (listeners) are executing before the if/write

* **BONUS:** Ask what the user’s birth year is. If they are under 18, alert the following: "You need a permission form from your parent or guardian to travel"

* **HINT:** You will need to use `document.write()` from prior activities.
