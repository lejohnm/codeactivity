### Your assignment

* Refactor the Car Object and add a function to fly the car!

  - Update the car object with a new boolean variable and two new functions
  - The boolean variable should be defined as isFlying. Set the default as false
  - one function, named flyTheCar, would be invoked when the letter f is selected. The function should check if the car is already flying and alert the user if it is. If the car is not currently flying, it should update the boolean variable and alert the user
  - another function, named landTheCar, would be invoked when the letter l is selected. The function should check if the car is not flying and would alert the user if it is on the ground. If it is flying, it should reset the boolean variable and alert the user that it just landed.
  - Be sure to update the instructions on the homepage with these super cool new commands for your flying car
