# DEMO - Rolling dice

This is the project that you will be building at the end of your first week of javascript (which is week 4 of the RTH Program), coding along with your video instructor. 

This small app reinforces some of the key concepts you will be learing as you launch your software engineering journey with one of the most popular language technologies across all platforms:

* workflow of a js program
* datatypes
* files
* functions
* events
* DOM Manipulation
* and so on
